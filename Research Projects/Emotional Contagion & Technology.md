# Emotional Contagion & Technology

Understanding Technological Features and Emotional Contagion

This project investigated how different features of communication channels impact individuals' experiences of emotional contagion during supportive interactions.

Project overview

- **Role:** Principal Investigator
- **Theoretical background & previous research:**
	- **Media Richness Theory** (Daft & Lengel, 1986): richer media (immediate feedback, multiple cues, personalization) support conveying emotional nuance.
	- **Social Presence Theory** (Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976): perceived presence affects emotional and interpersonal dynamics.
	- **Emotion as Social Information (EASI)** (Van Kleef, 2009): emotions act as social signals influencing observers via inferential processes and affective reactions.

Research process

- **Research questions:**
	- To what extent does emotional contagion vary across different communication channels?
	- How do support seekers' disclosures influence providers’ experiences of emotional contagion across channels?
	- How do providers' experiences of contagion shape evaluations of supportive interactions?
- **Method:** Remote laboratory experiments & surveys
- **Protocol (summary):**
	1. Participants recruited in pairs (established relationships).
	2. Pre-interaction survey; roles assigned (support seeker / provider).
	3. Dyads randomly assigned to communication channels (video, voice, or text) for a 15-minute conversation about a stressful event.
	4. Post-interaction survey completed by partners.

Analysis & key findings

- **Analysis:** Multi-group structural equation modeling
- **Key findings:**
	- Emotional contagion levels did not significantly differ across communication channels; transmission of emotions is robust across rich and lean media.
	- Greater disclosure by support seekers increased transmission of emotions between partners, regardless of channel.
	- Higher emotional contagion experienced by providers predicted more favorable evaluations of interaction quality by both partners.

Main takeaway

- When interacting via channels with fewer emotional cues, users adapt and use available tools (e.g., emojis in text) to convey emotions. This challenges assumptions from media richness and social presence theories and suggests that designers can facilitate emotional resonance in minimalist interfaces.
